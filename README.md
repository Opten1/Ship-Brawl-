# Ship Sailing Adventure

## Overview
"Ship Sailing Adventure" is a fast-paced 2D game where you control a ship navigating a sea filled with enemy ships and their bombs. The objective is to avoid obstacles and survive for as long as possible while earning points for every enemy ship that leaves the screen.

## Gameplay
- **Player Control**: Use the keyboard to move your ship up and down to avoid incoming obstacles and bombs.
- **Scoring**: Gain points each time an enemy ship exits the screen without colliding with you.
- **Obstacles**: Enemy ships move from right to left, and some ships can throw bombs.
- **Challenge**: The game gets progressively harder as the speed of the obstacles and bombs increases with your score.

## Controls
- **Arrow Key Up (↑)**: Move the ship up.
- **Arrow Key Down (↓)**: Move the ship down.

## Features
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The speed of obstacles and bombs increases as your score grows.
- **Randomized Obstacles**: Each enemy ship has a chance to throw bombs, adding an unpredictable element to gameplay.
- **Scoring System**: Track your progress with an on-screen score counter.
- **Graphics**: Immersive background and high-quality sprites for ships and bombs.
